Nowadays, Payment and Banking services are online, so it isn't necessary to go to an ATM and do your work through it.
All online payments in Iran must be done with One-Time Passwords. 

This is an app to collect all the one-time passwords from your phone's SMS.
You can get a new OTP password, and PuyaKhan copies it, and then you only need to paste that in the box.

The app can show a dialog box of all passwords when you need it, or show you a notification of the new password.

#### App Specifications
- Based on Material Design 3
- Designed by Jetpack Compose
- Users with Android 5.0 or higher are able to use this app.
