###### Made By SalTech

Nowadays, with payment and banking services moving online, visiting an ATM is often unnecessary. In Iran, all online payments require a One-Time Password (OTP).

**PuyaKhan** is an Android application designed to collect and manage all the one-time passwords sent to your phone via SMS. This app intelligently detects OTP messages, making it easier for you to access and use them.

## Key Features üöÄ

PuyaKhan is designed to simplify the process of using OTPs by offering a variety of features:

  * **Intelligent OTP Detection:** The app automatically analyzes incoming SMS messages to extract one-time passwords.
  * **Complete Information Extraction:** In addition to the code itself, it extracts and displays the **bank's name** and the **transaction amount**.
  * **Quick & Versatile Access Methods:** You can customize how you access new OTPs:
      * **Auto-Copy:** The OTP is automatically copied to your clipboard upon arrival.
      * **Notification:** A rich notification displays the full transaction details with a quick-copy button.
      * **Floating Window:** A small, floating window appears on your screen, allowing you to access the OTP without leaving your current app.
  * **OTP History:** The main screen shows a list of recent OTPs along with their expiration timers.
  * **Modern UI:** Built with **Jetpack Compose** following the latest **Material Design 3** guidelines.
  * **Optimized Performance:** The app is optimized to run smoothly on a wide range of devices, including those with low RAM.
  * **Privacy-Focused:** PuyaKhan does not require internet access, ensuring that your information is never sent online.

## Technical Details üõ†Ô∏è

This project showcases modern Android development practices and technologies:

  * **UI:** The entire user interface is built with **Jetpack Compose**, enabling a declarative and modern UI layer.
  * **Architecture:** The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and a scalable codebase.
  * **Data Persistence & Security:**
      * **Proto DataStore** is used for asynchronously storing the list of OTP codes in a structured and efficient way.
      * All stored data is encrypted using the **Android Keystore** system, providing hardware-backed security for sensitive information.
  * **Background Processing:**
      * A **Foreground Service** is implemented to keep the app alive in the background, ensuring it can listen for new SMS messages even on devices with aggressive battery optimization (like Xiaomi).
      * A **BroadcastReceiver** is used to listen for the `SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION` and `BOOT_COMPLETED` intents, allowing the app to process OTPs as soon as they arrive and to restart its service after the device reboots.
  * **Advanced OTP Parsing:** The core logic for extracting codes from SMS messages uses a sophisticated algorithm based on regular expressions and contextual keyword analysis. It identifies positive keywords (like "ÿ±ŸÖÿ≤", "code") and negative keywords (like "ÿ™ÿÆŸÅ€åŸÅ", "order") to accurately distinguish OTPs from other numerical data in messages.
